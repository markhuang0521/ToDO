Installation: for gradle config, I used Kotlin 1.7.0 and compose 1.2.0

this todo app uses compose for UI and stateFlow for UI state inside ViewModel.

MVVM  / repository pattern for the architecture and Room for local data access. (no dependency injection for database, just a simple singleton object for simplicity)

feature: add a new task, complete/ delete the current task.
